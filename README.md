# SPI-Optimizer: an integral-Separated PI Controller for Stochastic Optimization

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11305v1

### In this program,



## 1.Environment:

pytorch 0.4.0

python 2.7

matplotlib 2.0.2



## 2.Code:



### 2D_function:   you can use it to compare different functions on 2D using  trajectories, which can understand SPI better



- arrow_pic:  draw convergence path including red and green arrows

- loss_pic: draw loss

- trajectory_pic: draw trajectory



### experiment:  some experiments in paper



- experiment_code: code to run

- experiment_pic: draw and show results



**if you want to use the code to draw curves, "utils"  must be included in current path!**
